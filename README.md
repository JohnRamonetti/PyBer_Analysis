# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Matplotlib

## Overview
### Objective: The current analysis was carried out to explore and assess the access and affordability of PyBer ride sharing for different populations based on the types of city (urban, suburban or rural) in which the service is used.  Data was received for 120 cities in which the PyBer service is available, including the driver count and the city type for each of the cities.  Additionally, data was received for each ride provided for the first four months of the year in each of the noted cities, including the date, fare and ride ID, as well as the city, for each ride.  After reviewing and merging the data, exploratory analysis was carried out, then a summary of the data and a graph of the weekly fares by city type were prepared.
